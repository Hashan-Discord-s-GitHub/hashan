for those people that expressed interest in learning how to read logs, I'll lay out my process for the most recent one since it's pretty simple
first step is skip right to the end to see what the cause of death was, and in this case it's damage
from there you go back one attack at a time and see if there were actions taken that didn't work to prevent the death, or if there were opportunities that were passed up
in this log the last attack before the death is:
H:2566|36% M:5514|95%  12:28:20  [ Meloi ][45.6|0|0|0|0|0][blst kkbr] 
You have recovered balance on all limbs.
You have no stuff.
You rub some gecko on a vorpal sword.
so you can pretty much determine that attacking on 36% is 'wrong' if your goal is to survive
if the goal is to race then it's just luck and that's fine, but against fire lord who can entangle on demand I don't think it's generally worth momentum racing

from here you'd just determine what is the 'correct' play. I don't really know firelord that well so I'm not sure if shielding helps at all, but leaping away onto a wunjo nairat or dash n 2/leap e or something would have worked too
same process with the previous log (which was a win):
skip to end -> it's a victory -> no obvious incorrect decisions right near the end of the log, so the only option is to go line by line and analyse each of the attacks in turn to see if there's a point where efficiency breaks down or whatever
I am not personally familiar enough with snb or fire lord to read the situation that accurately to determine where there could be improvements which is why all I could come up with was leaping/walking not being that effective since there were lots of comet chases in a row (like before ereia got balance back from leap)

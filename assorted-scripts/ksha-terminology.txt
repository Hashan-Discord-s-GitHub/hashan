the terminologies are kinda fluid really
softlock: stops their curing but not forever, they have at least one way and usually multiple to get out
affs: asthma anorexia slickness, sometimes with impatience or paralysis added (but not both)
hardlock: usually only class stuff can get you out of this
affs: asthma anorexia slickness impatience paralysis
truelock: they cannot get out of this
affs: asthma anorexia slickness impatience paralysis + either disrupt and confusion OR class blocker, ideally you add prone too
riftlock: either arms or bound/web/transfix to stop outrift, and slickness/asthma to stop the apply for arms and smoke for slickness. if you're using binding rather than arms it's just temporary, but it's still a riftlock and stops them curing for a bit. countered by precaching cures (outrifting a bunch before you need them) which is then countered by addiction (consumes all herb/mineral of a type besides ginseng/ferrum when you eat)
affs: arms, slickness, asthma, potentially addiction see above
bloodfire lock (psion only): also called combustion lock. bloodfire gives uncurable slickness when they're bleeding over 150 and will last until they have no bleeding at all, so as long as haemo is stuck they have slickness
affs: haemophilia, bloodfire, anorexia, impatience
focus lock: you can't do impatience so you instead do as many focus affs or focus balance knocks to reduce the chance of focus hitting anorexia
affs: anorexia slickness asthma paralysis + mentals or off focus balance
mana lock: you can't do impatience so you instead reduce mana to 0 so they can't focus
affs: anorexia slickness asthma paralysis + less than 250 mana
